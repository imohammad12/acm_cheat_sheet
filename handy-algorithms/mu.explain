mu[i] = {0 if i contains a prime more than once
	 1 if i consists of even number of primes
	 -1 otherwise, ie. odd number of primes}
mu can be used to count number of things with gcd of 1 using inclution exclution
to do this: sigma_over_possible_j_as_product_of_primes(mu[j] * f(j))
where f(j) returns number of things where their gcd is divisible by every elemnt of j's factorization, ie. 'j'.
